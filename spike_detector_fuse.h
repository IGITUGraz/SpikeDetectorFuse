Name: spike_detector_fuse - Device for detecting single spikes, In addition, it also
      "fuses" the simulation on too much spiking

Description:

The following portion of the documentation is written for the spike detection
features (Borrowed from the documentation of the spike_detector device)

 The spike_detector_fuse device is a recording device. It is used to record
spikes from a single neuron, or from multiple neurons at once. Data
is recorded in memory or to file as for all RecordingDevices.
By default, GID and time of each spike is recorded.

The spike detector can also record spike times with full precision
from neurons emitting precisely timed spikes. Set /precise_times to
achieve this. If there are precise models and /precise_times is not
set, it will be set to True at the start of the simulation and
/precision will be increased to 15 from its default value of 3.

Any node from which spikes are to be recorded, must be connected to
the spike detector using a normal connect command. Any connection weight
and delay will be ignored for that connection.

Simulations progress in cycles defined by the minimum delay. During each
cycle, the spike detector records (stores in memory or writes to screen/file)
the spikes generated during the previous cycle. As a consequence, any
spikes generated during the cycle immediately preceding the end of the
simulation time will not be recorded. Setting the /stop parameter to at the
latest one min_delay period before the end of the simulation time ensures that
all spikes desired to be recorded, are recorded.

 Spike are not necessarily written to file in chronological order.

This portion is for the "fuse" portion of the documentation.

There are 3 important parameters for the spike_detector_fuse:

1.  frequency_thresh - Frequency Threshold
2.  length_thresh - Length of spiking to which this frequency threshold is acceptable
                    [full dynamics explained below]
3.  n_connected_neurons - Number of neurons connected to the spike_detector_fuse

The algorithm calculates a "danger trace" as follows:

 d[i+1] = d[i]*alpha + n_spikes_in_current_slice*delta

NOTE that the updating of danger is done once per slice and not once per step

The parameters alpha and delta are calculated as follows:

1.  A consistent firing of rate 'frequency_thresh' converges to a steady state danger level of 1
2.  A consistent firing of rate 'frequency_thresh' converges to 0.99 in length_thresh time
3.  The parameter n_connected_neurons must be specified from the user as NEST does not make this
    information available to the Node. This parameter is required to calculate the frequency of
    firing of individual neurons

If the value of the "Danger Trace" exceeds 1, an UnstableSpiking exception is thrown and the
simulation is aborted. Once the simulation is aborted in this manner, it can no longer be resumed.
The data for the simulation on the last run may be inconsistent in the sense that some neurons may
not have run their update function for the slice, but the spike data for that slice will be stored.

/**
 * Spike detector class with checks to detect unstable spiking.
 *
 * This class manages spike recording for normal and precise spikes. It
 * receives spikes via its handle(nest::SpikeEvent&) method, buffers them, and
 * stores them via its nest::RecordingDevice in the update() method.
 *
 * Spikes are buffered in a two-segment buffer. We need to distinguish between
 * two types of spikes: those delivered from the global event queue (almost all
 * spikes) and spikes delivered locally from devices that are replicated on VPs
 * (has_proxies() == false).
 * - Spikes from the global queue are delivered by deliver_events() at the
 *   beginning of each update cycle and are stored only until update() is called
 *   during the same update cycle. Global queue spikes are thus written to the
 *   read_toggle() segment of the buffer, from which update() reads.
 * - Spikes delivered locally may be delivered before or after
 *   spike_detector::update() is executed. These spikes are therefore buffered
 *   in the write_toggle() segment of the buffer and output during the next
 *   cycle.
 * - After all spikes are recorded, update() clears the read_toggle() segment
 *   of the buffer.
