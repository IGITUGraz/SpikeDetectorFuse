# Deadlock Test

##  How to install this test

This test creates a deadlock in NEST v2.12.0 by throwing an error from exactly one thread. It is created as a module 'nestdeadlocktestmodule' which can be compiled and installed via the accompanying installation script 'install.sh', To use it use the Python 'nest.Install' or the sli equivalent.

##  Installation requirements

1.  The test is in python3 so it requires the appropriately compiled NEST before installation.
2.  In order to use the modules in python, the modules directory must be a part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

##  How to run

After having installed via './install.sh', simply run the python script via python3, it should print a success message and then hang on the next simulation. Note that once this happens, the only way to kill the process is using the `kill` command.
